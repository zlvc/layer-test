/**
 * Sets up simple webhook listening on /message-delivered
 * which will post a message if 5 minutes pass without anyone receiving the message.
 * This could be used to notify the sender that none of the people they are sending to are avaialable.
 *
 * This webhook caches any newly sent messages in a messages hash, and removes from the cache
 * any time a message is deleted.  If any delivery receipts occur, then someone has received it and
 * there is no need to notify the user; so we delete the message from our hash in that case as well.
